# Introduction

"JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed."

  

Okay okay, but, WHAT IS THIS? it's not tangible, is it? I mean, it's a great answer to pop when the interviewer ask you about JWT.

But you are here to UNDERSTAND. And frankly, you must be so Fucked to be here, since my tiny blog can't be the ones you see on the google first page when you search "what is JWT". It's okay, I have been there too. That's why I decided to write this Article.

And as carl young famously said, "The road to enlightment, is to be fucked first". so what is JWT?
