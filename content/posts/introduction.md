# Hello World!

I'm Yasin. A computer science student and passionate programmer. I live in Iran. Which do not brings good thing on your google search at this moment. Many Have died by the evil Government. Many brave people. But hopefuly, I will post the news of our Freedom here, soon. 

Shit, it's the first blog post and I talk about the politics. But beileive me, I do not wanted to talk about any of thsi. I hate politics. But living in Iran, is all about politcs. It's all about the things you hate, but can't, and should not ignore. How can I talk about my country without mention the lives now gone? without mention the devil that governs? how can I tell, in 2026, our internet was cut off for 25 days, and still, after *beign back to normal*, is not normal, and it has never been? can you believe that? So yeah, when introduce myself, I need to talk about this shit too. 

I really hope to talk about good things in later posts.

anyway, I made this blog with Hugo and tailwindcss. Hosted on Github pages. For free,
which is awesome service by github, and it is more than enough, for a need of a tiney 
blog just to write on it. Exactly what I wanted!

I wanted a blog to write on it. Yes, very modest desire. I had a web page that was only a refrence, or, more accurately, a brief introduction and some links to socials.
I had this page, for couple of years. And then it was clicked, on my mind. "Github offers this cool feeature fo having a blog, why not... having a blog?" I asked me.
And I've learned hugo a year ago. More importantely, I realized the importance, and great effect of writing. Writing fosters learning. The feynman technique: if I can write to explain complex things simply, I turly have learned the subject. Furthurmore, writing improves critical thinking. Speaking about myself, recently (specially in this situation of my country) I have no focus. It's all distraction in my head. Noises. But with the help of writing (without using AI, atleast till the final draft), I can think, I can trully think.
Combining all this reasons, I guess it's a good act of me to, build this blog. And hopefully, write. 
So what I would write about on this blog? To be honest, I didn't think that far!
Probably, I will write about the topics I learn, about tech, programming, computer science in general. But I will not restricted to only write about technology, I write about anything I learn and I can write about. Maybe I even write about silly things, and just have fun! 
Essentialy, this blog will be a online journal, with a lil bit of love to CS.

I have some Idea to improve this blog, technically. Adding features and stuff. But I guess, writing, acutall posting of something on my blog, should be my first priority, since I am very lazy. I don't wanna do vow, or promise, or declare ... I just try my best, to write and publish, for the sake of writing, and learning, and growing. I do not looking for viewrs (although you are all welcome), or getting some more people know me. I know there are probaly nothing I can teach anyone. There are many blog post written more technically and comprehensive about any tech topic I want to cover, and they are matchless with mine. My post would probably not even be fun to read, and bad written (from a real writer prespective). But as I said, I only aim to write, and leverage its benefits, for me. I try to be original, and let my unique texts (even though bad), be my only trade. As like everyones.

Thanks for reading till the end!
I guess there is nothing important I need to adress at my first post.
But I do welcome, and appreciate any Qs, review, suggestion, or anything. 
I do not have comment section yet, so you can write to me via my [email](yasin@amirany.ir).


Alright, be safe and sound dear readers.
Stay curious.
